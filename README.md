# DeFi Hacks Reproduce - Foundry
**Reproduce DeFi hack incidents using Foundry.**

This repo is me learning about smart contracts hacks and recreating what has already been brilliantly put together at [DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs)

All I'm doing is elaborating a bit on the steps as I need to step through each of them to solidify my learnings.
